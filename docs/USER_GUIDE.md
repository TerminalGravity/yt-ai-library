## Video Selection and Ingestion

### Choosing Videos to Ingest

**Quality over quantity**: Select videos that:
- Are relevant to your learning goals
- Have good audio quality (for accurate transcripts)
- Cover topics you want to study or reference
- Are in a language the AI can process (primarily English)

**Video requirements**:
- Must have captions or auto-generated transcripts
- Should be publicly accessible
- Work best with educational or informational content

### Managing Ingested Content

2. Click the "+" button next to the channel name in the sidebar
3. Select additional videos from the channel
4. Start a new ingestion process

**Video limitations**:
- Some videos may not have transcripts available
- Private or restricted videos cannot be processed
- Very short videos (under 30 seconds) may not provide useful content

## Using the Chat Interface

### Starting a Conversation

1. **Navigate to the Chat tab** in your channel library
2. **Type your question** in the input box
3. **Press Enter** or click "Send"

### Types of Questions You Can Ask

**Conceptual questions**:
- "What is machine learning?"
- "Explain the concept of neural networks"
- "How does photosynthesis work?"

**Specific topic searches**:
- "What did they say about climate change?"
- "Find information about Python programming"
- "Tell me about the history discussed in these videos"

**Comparative questions**:
- "What are the differences between X and Y?"
- "Compare the approaches mentioned for solving this problem"

**Summary requests**:
- "Summarize the main points about this topic"
- "What are the key takeaways from this channel?"

### Understanding AI Responses

**Response structure**:
- **Main answer**: Direct response to your question
- **Source citations**: Relevant video excerpts with timestamps
- **Confidence indicators**: AI responses are based on available content

**Source information includes**:
- Video title and direct link
- Timestamp range (clickable to jump to specific moments)
- Content preview showing relevant transcript excerpt
- Similarity score indicating relevance

### Chat Best Practices

**Effective questioning**:
- Be specific about what you want to know
- Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper
- Use natural language - no need for special syntax

**Getting better results**:
- Start with broader questions, then narrow down
- Reference specific videos if you remember them
- Ask for examples or explanations when concepts are unclear

## Semantic Search

### How Semantic Search Works

Unlike keyword search, semantic search understands the meaning behind your query and finds conceptually related content even if the exact words don't match.

### Using the Search Interface

1. **Navigate to the Search tab** in your channel library
2. **Enter your search query** using natural language
3. **Review results** ranked by relevance

### Search Examples

**Topic-based searches**:
- "artificial intelligence applications"
- "sustainable energy solutions"
- "data visualization techniques"

**Concept searches**:
- "how to improve productivity"
- "effective communication strategies"
- "problem-solving methods"

**Question-based searches**:
- "why is this approach better?"
- "what are the benefits of this method?"
- "how does this process work?"

### Understanding Search Results

**Result information**:
- **Similarity score**: Percentage indicating how well the content matches your query
- **Video title**: Source video name
- **Content excerpt**: Relevant transcript portion
- **Timestamp**: Exact moment in the video
- **Direct link**: Jump to the specific moment in the video

**Result ranking**:
- Results are ordered by semantic similarity
- Higher percentages indicate better matches
- Multiple results from the same video show different relevant moments
